_Time complexity: O(1) to set every key_

Set the the respective keys to the respective values. MSET will replace old
values with new values, while MSETNX will not perform any operation at all
even if just a single key already exists.

Because of this semantic MSETNX can be used in order to set different keys
representing different fields of an unique logic object in a way tha
ensures that either all the fields or none at all are set.

Both MSET and MSETNX are atomic operations. This means that for instance
if the keys A and B are modified, another client talking to Redis can either
see the changes to both A and B at once, or no modification at all.

## MSET Return value

[Status code reply][1] Basically +OK as MSET can't fail

## MSETNX Return value

[Integer reply][1], specifically:

	1 if the all the keys were se
	0 if no key was set (at least one key already existed)
