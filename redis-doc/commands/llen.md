_Time complexity: O(1)_

Return the length of the list stored at the specified key. If the
key does not exist zero is returned (the same behaviour as for
empty lists). If the value stored at _key_ is not a list an error is returned.

## Return value

[Integer reply][1], specifically:

`The length of the list.`
