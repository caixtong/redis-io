O(log(N))+O(M) (with N being the number of elements in the
sorted set and M the number of elements requested)_

Return the specified elements of the sorted set at the specified
key. The elements are considered sorted from the lowerest to the highes
score when using ZRANGE, and in the reverse order when using ZREVRANGE.
Start and end are zero-based indexes. 0 is the first elemen
of the sorted set (the one with the lowerest score when using ZRANGE), 1
the next element by score and so on.

_start_ and _end_ can also be negative numbers indicating offsets
from the end of the sorted set. For example -1 is the last element of
the sorted set, -2 the penultimate element and so on.

Indexes out of range will not produce an error: if start is over
the end of the sorted set, or start  end, an empty list is returned.
If end is over the end of the sorted set Redis will threat it just like
the last element of the sorted set.

It's possible to pass the WITHSCORES option to the command in order to return no
only the values but also the scores of the elements. Redis will return the data
as a single list composed of value1,score1,value2,score2,...,valueN,scoreN but clien
libraries are free to return a more appropriate data type (what we think is tha
the best return type for this command is a Array of two-elements Array / Tuple in
order to preserve sorting).

@return

[Multi bulk reply][1], specifically a list of elements in the specified range.
